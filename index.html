Desert you

We're no strangers to love

<br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
We've known each other for so long
<br>
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (To say it)

Inside, we both know what's been going on (Going on)
<br>
We know the game, and we're gonna play it

<br>
[Pre-Chorus]
<br>
And if you ask me how I'm feeling

Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
<br>
Never gonna let you down

Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
<br>
Never gonna give you up
<br>
Never gonna let you down
<br>
Never gonna run around and desert you

Never gonna make you cry
<br>
Never gonna say goodbye
<br>
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
